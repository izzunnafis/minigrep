In the land of dreams, dreams unfold,
Where shadows dance and stories are told.
Whispers echo, echo in the night,
Filling the darkness with a gentle light.

In the land of dreams, dreams take flight,
Where hopes soar high, reaching new heights.
Laughter rings, rings through the air,
Creating a melody beyond compare.

In the land of dreams, dreams come alive,
Where love blossoms, helping hearts thrive.
Tears flow, flow like a gentle stream,
Washing away sorrow, making spirits gleam.
